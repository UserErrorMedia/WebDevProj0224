The website is coded as one responsive landing page with an external link to a page with a contact form.

The "Home" and "About" options in the navigation bar are links to the main landing page contained in TechSolutions.html.
The "Contact" option as well as the "Sign Up" button are links to the Contact page contained in Contact.html

JavaScript: The top navigation bar will collapse into a hamburger menu when the dimensions of the device are shrunken to mobile size. It operates on a "click" function and cascades from the top of the screen downwards. 

The Contact page contains a contact form with a submit button (which has not been coded to send in an email at this time). The navigation bar on this page has been reduced to only one option which takes you back to the "Home" or main landing page.
